## Project introduction

This is another project made during the TOP curriculum - intermediate HTML and CSS course.

## Project function

The project features:

- complete layout using grid and flexbox
- responsive grid layout for project cards
- theme changing functionality - dark or light

## Room for improvement

The project could still be more responsive, but I will leave some room for future improvements.
